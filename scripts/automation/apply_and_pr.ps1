.SYNOPSIS
    Applies the daily automation patch, gates it, and opens a PR if it does not regress.

.DESCRIPTION
    The cloud automation cannot reach GitHub (the sandbox proxy blocks it), so it delivers a
    unified diff into the user workspace instead. This script is the local half of that
    pipeline: it retrieves the patch, applies it to a CLEAN worktree at origin/main, runs the
    real gates before and after, and opens a pull request only if nothing regressed.

    Three design decisions worth understanding before editing this file:

    1. It works in a `git worktree` at origin/main, NEVER in the developer's checkout. The
       checkout routinely carries unrelated in-flight changes (33 at the time of writing,
       including a mid-rename Makefile), so applying a patch there would make gate failures
       unattributable and could corrupt someone else's work.

    2. The PR condition is NO REGRESSION versus a baseline, not an absolute pass. The
       baseline may already be red from in-flight work on main, and a shared virtualenv can
       distort results. Measuring before and after in the same worktree cancels both, because
       whatever distorts one run distorts the other identically.

    3. It uses SQL PUT/GET rather than `cortex ws cp`, which is broken on Windows in both
       directions (upload fails with "undefined is not a directory"; download mangles the
       path to C:\C:\...).

    The script never merges, never pushes to main, and never creates a tag. A pull request
    cannot land by itself, so human review remains the last gate.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Do everything except push the branch and open the PR. Reports what it would have done.

.PARAMETER PatchFile
    Use a local patch file instead of fetching from the workspace. For testing.

.PARAMETER ManifestFile
    Use a local MANIFEST.json instead of fetching it. For testing the lineage gate itself,
    which is otherwise only exercisable by waiting for a real night.

.PARAMETER SkipManifest
    Apply without a manifest at all. Only for testing the pre-manifest behaviour; a real run
    must never use it, because the manifest is the only thing that distinguishes tonight's
    verified patch from a leftover file.

.PARAMETER SkipTests
    Skip `make test` (the two pytest passes). Speeds up a smoke test of the plumbing at the
    cost of the gate that matters most. Never use for a real run.

.PARAMETER Connection
    Snowflake connection profile used to retrieve the patch. Defaults to the headless
    key-pair profile. The interactive OAuth profile cannot be used unattended: it needs a
    browser once its cached token expires.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/automation/apply_and_pr.ps1
    powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/automation/apply_and_pr.ps1 -DryRun -PatchFile C:\tmp\test.patch

    Exit codes:
      0  PR opened, or genuinely nothing to pick up
      1  BLOCKED: patch did not apply, touched a protected path, or regressed a gate
      2  RETRIEVAL FAILED: could not reach the workspace, state UNKNOWN
      3  MANIFEST REFUSED: no manifest, stage 4 not OK, or the run is from a previous night

    3 is deliberately distinct from both 0 and 2. Read as 0 it would look like a quiet night;
    read as 2 it would look like a broken connection. It means neither: the pipeline ran and
    declined to certify its own output, which is a normal and useful outcome.

# Decides whether the cloud pipeline actually certified tonight's patch.
#
# The four cloud stages hand off through /workspace, and MANIFEST.json is the only record of
# WHICH night's work is sitting there. Without this check the script cannot tell tonight's
# verified patch from a changes.patch left behind by a run that died three days ago: a stale
# file applies just as cleanly as a fresh one, and gates that pass on it would produce a
# perfectly plausible pull request for work nobody asked for tonight.
#
# Three conditions, all required:
#   1. Stage 4 recorded status OK. Stage 4 is the one that re-applies the patch to a pristine
#      tree and runs the checks, so its OK is the pipeline's own certification. A stage that
#      wrote FAILED is telling us not to ship, and that must be honoured, not overridden
#      because the patch happens to apply here.
#   2. The run is recent. Compared with a one-day tolerance rather than exact equality: this
#      script runs at 03:00 local while publishing happens at 00:00 local, and both land on the
#      same UTC date only while the local clock is before 05:30. More importantly, the task is
#      registered StartWhenAvailable, so a laptop asleep at 03:00 defers the run to the next
#      wake, which can be the following morning in a different UTC date. Exact equality would
#      reject valid work for that reason alone.
#   3. The manifest parses and carries a run_id. A malformed manifest is a refusal, not a
#      warning: it means the pipeline's own bookkeeping is broken.

# archive`, which emits the LF blob content". That was FALSE. `git archive` applies the same eol
# conversion as a checkout, so it was emitting a CRLF snapshot, and a fire's patch therefore
# carried CRLF context lines that could never match this LF worktree. GNU patch says
# "different line endings"; `git apply` says only "patch does not apply", which reads as a stale
# snapshot and sent one investigation the wrong way. The defect hid for weeks because a patch
# that only ADDS files has no context lines to match and applied fine either way - so the
# pipeline looked healthy while being unable to deliver any modification to an existing file.
# publish_run_inputs.ps1 now passes -c core.autocrlf=false to git archive and ASSERTS the result

Automated implementation from the daily Cortex Code automation.

**Do not merge without reading the diff.** This was written by an unattended agent. It ran
its own tests in the sandbox, but the authoritative gates below were run here, against a
clean worktree at ``origin/main`` with the patch applied, in a venv repointed so that
``import dataforge`` resolves to the patched tree.

| Gate | Baseline @ $baseSha | After patch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``make lint`` (verbatim) | $($before['lint']) | $($after['lint']) |
| ``make type`` (verbatim) | $($before['type']) | $($after['type']) |
| ``pytest tests/ -n logical`` | $(if ($before['test'] -is [string]) { $before['test'] } else { "$($before['test'].Failed) failed, $($before['test'].Errors) errors" }) | $(if ($after['test'] -is [string]) { $after['test'] } else { "$($after['test'].Failed) failed, $($after['test'].Errors) errors" }) |

The test row compares **failure counts**, not exit codes: this suite is flaky in a worktree
under ``-n logical`` (an unmodified ``origin/main`` has produced 0 and 12 collection errors on
consecutive runs), and comparing exit codes let a real 2-test regression through unblocked.

A gate that was already failing at baseline does not block, since that failure predates this
patch. Only a pass-to-fail transition blocks.
