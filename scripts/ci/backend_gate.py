# The `datasets` exception was DELETED on 2026-08-30 by taking the fix, not by re-dating the
# expiry. It was the last entry, and it was retired for two independent reasons.
#
# First, the fix was available. PYSEC-2026-3716 (= CVE-2026-66007) is fixed in datasets 5.0.1,
# and the exception's stated blocker -- that moving to 5.x meant "a deliberate training-stack
# revalidation" because train pins trl==1.4.0 and transformers==5.7.0 -- was false. PyPI metadata:
# trl 1.4.0 requires `datasets>=4.7.0` with NO upper bound, and transformers 5.7.0 does not
# require datasets in its core dependencies at all. Measured in a throwaway venv on Python
# 3.12.10: the full train extra resolves with datasets 5.0.1 and every other pin held exactly,
# `pip check` clean, pip-audit "No known vulnerabilities found". A probe of the only API surface
# this repo uses -- Dataset.from_list on the SFT and GRPO row shapes, and the packaged json
# builder -- compared 45 observable properties across 4.8.5 and 5.0.1 and found ZERO differences.
# `pyproject.toml` now pins `datasets==5.0.1`. Same precedent as the torch and pymdown entries.
#
# Second, and worth recording because it is the more instructive half: the exception's own scope
# statement was WRONG in three specifics, so keeping it on that reasoning was not an option.
# It claimed "there is no load_dataset call" -- there are six, across five notebooks under
# training/. It cited "11 sites: scripts/remote/kaggle_*.py and training/kaggle_*_kernel/*.py",
# but `from datasets import` appears in 10 first-party files, no `.py` file exists under any
# `kaggle_*_kernel/` directory (those imports are in `.ipynb`), and the glob missed
# eval/results/kaggle_sft_v9_smoke_pull/*.py entirely. The reachability VERDICT survived, on the
# narrower ground that `load_dataset("json", data_files=...)` selects the packaged json builder
# while the advisory is scoped to FOLDER-BASED builders' `file_name` metadata -- but a triage
# justified by a false statement of fact is not a triage. See
# docs/trust/dependency-advisory-triage.md.
#
# Two pymdown-extensions exceptions were DELETED on 2026-08-28 for the same reason: the blocker
# they cited cleared upstream. Both had argued the fix was unreachable: mkdocs-material 9.6.23
# required `pymdown-extensions~=10.2`, capping below 11, while PYSEC-2026-3609 (b64 path
# traversal) is fixed in 11.0.0 and CVE-2026-67422 (exponential ReDoS in caret/tilde/betterem/
# magiclink) in 11.0.1. mkdocs-material 9.7.0 relaxed that requirement to `>=10.2`, so
# docs/requirements.txt now pins mkdocs-material 9.7.7 with pymdown-extensions 11.0.2 and the
# advisories are simply fixed. Recorded here because deleting an exception silently looks
# identical to forgetting one: an ignore that suppresses nothing is not harmless, it still
# carries an expiry that fails the gate for a vulnerability the environment no longer has.
#
# That failure mode is now mechanical rather than remembered -- see
# :func:`pip_audit_exception_liveness_errors`.
