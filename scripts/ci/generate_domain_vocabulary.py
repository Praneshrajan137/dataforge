"""Generate the TypeScript twin of the domain vocabulary from its Python source.

The browser needs the same closed vocabularies the engine reasons about. It used to get
them by hand-transcription, and the copies disagreed three times -- once in the function
every trust surface routes through, and once in the certificate a third party reads.

So the vocabulary is written once, in ``dataforge/domain/vocabulary.py``, and this
script projects it into TypeScript. The generated file is committed (so the frontend
builds without Python) and verified byte-for-byte by ``--check`` in CI, which is what
makes the two sides provably identical rather than nominally in sync.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/generate_domain_vocabulary.py --check
    python scripts/ci/generate_domain_vocabulary.py --write

# never projected. A frozen population that fails loudly and then disappears is still a frozen
# population. This is the same defect corrected in ``scripts/ci/readme_truth.py`` the same day;
