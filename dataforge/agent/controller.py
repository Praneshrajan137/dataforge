"""Verified autonomous agent controller for DataForge.

This is the production entry point that makes DataForge *truly agentic* without
weakening its moat. The control flow is:

1. **Deterministic-first seed.** Run detectors and the deterministic repairers
   (the high-accuracy floor). Their fixes are already safety+SMT verified by
   :func:`dataforge.engine.repair.propose_repairs`.
2. **Closed agent loop over the residual.** For issues the rules could not fix,
   an autonomous policy proposes actions. Every ``FIX`` is gated by the same
   safety constitution and SMT verifier; rejections are fed back so the policy
   self-corrects.
3. **Proven-only gate.** An agent value is LLM-derived, so it is *proven* only when
   an authoritative schema verified it. Otherwise it was checked solely by the
   advisory inferred guard -- where the known verifier-floor gaps live -- so it is
   ``plausibility_only`` and is HELD in ``held_fixes`` rather than written.
4. **Single verified commit.** Floor and proven agent fixes commit through the
   existing :func:`dataforge.engine.repair.apply_transaction` -- the same atomic,
   journaled, byte-for-byte reversible write path the CLI already uses.

Because the agent only *adds* proven fixes on top of the deterministic floor, its
output can never be worse than the deterministic baseline.

**What is and is not guaranteed.** No unproven value reaches disk unless the caller
sets ``allow_unproven_autoapply``, and that choice is recorded truthfully as
not-proven in the certificate. This holds for any policy, however weak or
adversarial, because the gate is enforced inside ``apply_transaction`` itself rather
than by this controller remembering to call it.

That wording is deliberately narrower than what this docstring claimed until
2026-08-09. It previously said "nothing unverified ever reaches disk -- regardless of
how weak or adversarial the policy is", which was FALSE: this controller called
``apply_transaction`` directly, skipping the proven-only partition, and a schema-less
``llm_live`` value was written after clearing only a structural check (row in bounds,
column exists). See DECISIONS.md 2026-08-09 and
``tests/property/test_no_corruption_invariant.py``.
