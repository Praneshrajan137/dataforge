class UncheckableDetectorWriteError(RepairEngineError):

    detector is not in :data:`CONSTRAINT_CHECKABLE_DETECTORS`.

    This is a DIFFERENT failure from :class:`UnprovenWriteError`, and the two are kept
    separate because a caller hitting one needs a different remedy than a caller hitting
    the other. An ``UnprovenWriteError`` says "this value was never checked against an
    authority"; this says "the procedure that produced this value is deterministic, and
    may well be *proven* in the strength sense, but its correctness cannot be checked
    against anything outside the column's own distribution." Determinism is not
    soundness -- see ``docs/trust/deterministic-is-not-sound.md``.

    Why this lives at the primitive rather than only in :func:`partition_auto_apply`:
    because on 2026-08-22 it did only live there, and the agent controller -- which never
    calls :func:`partition_auto_apply` -- wrote a ``decimal_shift`` fix that the legacy
    pipeline held, on the SAME table, with no schema. Measured: ``4,1020`` became
    ``4,102`` via ``run_agent_repair`` while ``run_repair_pipeline`` refused. The
    strength gate did not catch it because ``verification_strength_for("deterministic",
    ...)`` is ``proven`` regardless of schema, so the allowlist was simply never
    consulted on that surface.

    That is the same class of defect, and the same remedy, as
    :class:`UnprovenWriteError` itself: enforce at the primitive, so a write surface
    cannot bypass the gate by forgetting to call the partitioner first.
    """


class UnprovenWriteError(RepairEngineError):
    """Raised when a gated mutation primitive is handed a ``plausibility_only`` fix.

    The proven-only invariant is enforced *inside* the mutation primitives rather than
    at each calling surface, so a caller that simply forgot the gate gets this exception
    instead of a silent unproven write. Callers that legitimately want an unproven write
    must say so explicitly via ``allow_unproven_autoapply``.

    Scope, stated exactly (an earlier version of this docstring said "the two mutation
    primitives", which was false -- the same class of scope error this gate exists to
    prevent). The gate is enforced at:

    * :func:`apply_transaction` -- the journaled CSV path.
    * ``DuckDBStore.apply_patch_plan`` -- the warehouse SQL path, via
      :func:`dataforge.stores.patch_plan.enforce_plan_proven_only`.

    It is NOT enforced at these paths, each for a stated reason:

    * :func:`_apply_fixes_to_csv` -- the raw byte-writer beneath
      :func:`apply_transaction`. It takes ``CellFix``, which carries no provenance, so
      strength is not merely unchecked but *undecidable* there. It is private and called
      only from this module; that, not a gate, is what keeps it off other surfaces.
    * ``dataforge.transactions.revert.revert_transaction`` -- restores bytes this tool
      previously recorded, so there is no new value to prove. Gated instead by audit-log
      verification and a post-state hash match.
    * ``dataforge.schema_inference.write_constraint_review_artifact_atomic`` -- rewrites
      the user's *constraints* artifact, not their data. It has no proven-only gate
      because it mutates the PREMISE of provenness rather than a value; see
      ``docs/trust/authority-is-mutable.md``.

    The authoritative registry of write primitives, with each one's classification and
    gate, is ``tests/integration/test_surface_uniformity.py::_WRITE_PRIMITIVE_REGISTRY``.

    Set ``True`` to restore the pre-2026-09-07 behaviour, in which accepting a mined
    candidate in ``dataforge constraints review`` was treated as equivalent to declaring
    it. That equivalence is unmeasured and is upstream of every corruption this project
    has measured. See ``eval/preregistration/premise_acquisition.md`` and
    ``docs/trust/premise-acquisition-result.md``.

    **This makes the zero-config path write less, and that is not automatically a win.**
    PRODUCT.md: "Zero writes is not a safety result."

    **Corrected 2026-09-08. This docstring previously read that "capability moves from the
    miner's guess to the user's stated premise -- on hospital, the mined premise produced 451
    repairs with 116 corruptions, while the declared premise produced 393 with none."** Both
    halves were wrong, and measurably so.

    The 393 / 0 pair is the **oracle** arm of ``measure_deductive_coverage.py``: functional
    dependencies discovered from the CLEAN frame and admitted only if they hold on ground truth.
    Its own docstring says "No user has this. It is the ceiling." Calling it "the declared
    premise" credited a ground-truth-derived upper bound to a user's schema file.

    And capability does not move to the user's premise. Measured through this pipeline in
    ``docs/trust/declared-premise-capability.md``, a premise authored from the corpus's public
    data dictionary raises 8,223 FD issues, has the repairer propose 399 repairs, and writes
    **zero** cells. The ceiling itself -- the oracle premise through this same write path --
    writes 54 for F1 0.1918 against the proposal stage's 0.8352. A probe in that document
    settles that this is not a penalty for hand-authoring: a 13-dependency premise every member
    of which is admitted by ground truth also writes zero.

    So C4 gives up a capability that was already unreachable here rather than relocating it.
    That does not retract C4 -- nothing was corrupted under either premise, and the oracle arm's
    54 writes were all correct -- but the empirical case for it is the corruption count, not a
    transfer of capability to the user.

    Reversibility is the strongest promise in ``PRODUCT.md`` -- stronger than proven-only,
    because a reversible wrong write costs a revert while an irreversible one costs the
    data. On this path it was achieved by *ordering*: ``create_repair_transaction`` writes
    the snapshot and journal before ``_apply_fixes_to_csv`` runs, so a correct sequence
    yields a recoverable state. Ordering is not a precondition, though. Nothing checked
    that the snapshot reached disk intact, and the failure mode is silent in the worst
    direction: a truncated or missing snapshot is indistinguishable from a good one until
    the revert that needs it, which is exactly when the user has no other copy.

    ``transactions/revert.py`` restores by writing the snapshot bytes back and comparing
    the result against ``transaction.source_sha256``. So the precondition for that revert
    succeeding is checkable here, before any byte of user data changes: the snapshot must
    exist and must hash to the value the revert will demand of it.

    This is the CSV counterpart of :func:`dataforge.stores.patch_plan.enforce_plan_reversible`.

    the advisory inferred guard where the verifier-floor gaps live) is NEVER auto-applied
    unless ``allow_unproven_autoapply`` is explicitly set -- and then it is recorded
    truthfully as unproven.

    **Deterministic no longer means unconditional, and that fix is the reason this
    docstring changed.** It previously read "among proven fixes, deterministic ones
    always auto-apply", and the code was ``if deterministic or policy.action_for(...)``.
    The ``or`` short-circuited the calibration gate, so ``enabled_classes == []``
    protected nothing on the deterministic path. Measured consequence: a live
    ``dataforge repair --apply`` on a 25-row table with no errors rewrote a legitimate
    ``1131.20`` as ``113120`` -- a 100x monetary inflation -- recorded ``proven``, held
    back by nothing. On error-free TPC-H the same rule would rewrite 263,428 monetary
    values, and it has found **zero** true errors on hospital, flights or rayyan.

    A deterministic fix now bypasses calibration only when its detector is in

    classified is calibration-bound rather than exempt. Detectors that infer a repair
    from the column's own distribution go through the same threshold as any other
    fallible source, which under the shipped propose-not-apply policy means they are
    held for review.

    When ``calibration_map_by_class`` is provided, an LLM fix's raw confidence is
    first rescaled through its per-issue-type post-hoc calibration map so the score
    matches the scale the conformal thresholds were certified on. This is a monotone

    wave through a fix the raw policy would have held below a raw-scale threshold.

    The second half of the primitive-level write gate. :func:`enforce_proven_only`
    enforces the STRENGTH dimension (was this value checked against an authority);
    this enforces the SOUNDNESS dimension (can the procedure that produced it be
    checked against anything at all).

    The two are genuinely separable, which is why they are two functions and two
    exception types rather than one. A ``decimal_shift`` fix on a schema-covered column
    is ``proven`` by the strength predicate -- ``verification_strength_for`` returns
    ``proven`` for every ``deterministic`` provenance, schema or no schema -- and is
    still not something the product can stand behind, because the only evidence for it
    is the shape of the column's own distribution.

    There is deliberately no ``allow_*`` opt-in parameter. ``allow_unproven_autoapply``
    exists because an unproven write is a defensible product choice: the value stays
    reversible and the certificate records it honestly as not-proven. An
    uncheckable-detector write is not a defensible choice at any confidence, because
    there is no evidence to record -- the measured false-positive rate on realistically
    dispersed money columns was 263,428 cells across three TPC-H tables with zero true
    errors. A flag here would be a flag for corrupting data on request. Callers wanting
    the value must take it from the review queue, where it is surfaced honestly.

    Raises:
        UncheckableDetectorWriteError: If any fix has ``deterministic`` provenance and a
            detector outside :data:`CONSTRAINT_CHECKABLE_DETECTORS`. The message names
            both the detector and the allowlist, because a caller hitting this needs to
            know which of the two gates refused and why.
