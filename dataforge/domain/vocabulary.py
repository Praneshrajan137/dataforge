"""The ubiquitous language of DataForge, defined exactly once.

Every closed vocabulary the product reasons about lives here: how strong a claim is,
where a value came from, why something was held, how severe an issue is, and what a
verifier decided. Other modules re-export these names; nothing re-declares them.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The same six vocabularies were previously written out by hand in three to five
places -- the engine, the terminal humanizer, the HTTP contract, the browser, and the
design tokens -- with prose comments asserting they were "kept in sync". They were
not. Three drifts shipped:

1. ``entity_consensus`` was missing from the browser's untrusted-provenance set, so
   ``strengthOf()`` reported an untrusted value as ``proven`` in the one function
   every trust surface routes through.
2. ``REVIEW_REASON_COPY`` carried 12 of 13 reasons, so one held fix rendered as a raw
   machine token.
3. ``dataforge/certificate.py`` carried a three-member untrusted set against the
   engine's four -- in the artifact a third party reads to decide whether to trust a
   write. That one said "proven" about a value nothing had proven.

A constant in two places is a constant that will disagree. The product's claim is
truthfulness, so a vocabulary drift here is not a style problem; it is the failure
mode itself.

Two design rules
----------------
**This module is a leaf.** It imports nothing but the standard library -- no pydantic,
no engine, no rich. That purity is load-bearing: it lets the dependency-free
certificate verifier import the real vocabulary instead of copying it, and it keeps
this file readable as the source text a second implementation is written from.

**Trust decisions read the TRUSTED set, never the untrusted one.** Testing membership
of a known-bad list fails open: any value nobody thought of is treated as safe. Every
predicate here is written against the allowlist, so an unrecognised provenance is
untrusted by construction. That is the difference between a vocabulary and a guess.

# `plausibility_only` may not (absent an explicit, recorded opt-in).

# --- Provenance ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Where a proposed value came from.
#
# **`deterministic` means the PROCEDURE is deterministic, not that the INFERENCE is
# sound.** An earlier version of this comment read "`deterministic` is correct by
# construction -- derived from the table by a rule that cannot invent a value". That
# was false, and the falsehood was load-bearing: it justified letting deterministic
# fixes bypass the calibration gate entirely.
#
# Measured 2026-08-22. The `decimal_shift` rule is deterministic and infers a repair
# from the column's own distribution. It scored precision **0.0000** on hospital
# (39 flags), flights (92) and rayyan (112) -- zero true errors found on any of them --
# and on error-free TPC-H it would rewrite **263,428** monetary values, plus 9.86% of
# `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY.total_elapsed_time`. A live CLI run rewrote a
# legitimate `1131.20` as `113120` and recorded it as `proven`.
#
# A rule that cannot invent a value can still deterministically choose the wrong one.
# Trust is earned by measurement, not conferred by implementation category -- which is
# what `PRODUCT.md` already says, and the deterministic path was the one place it was
# not applied. See `CONSTRAINT_CHECKABLE_DETECTORS` below, and
# `docs/trust/deterministic-is-not-sound.md`.
#
# Everything other than `deterministic` is a proposal from a source that can be
# confidently wrong, including `entity_consensus`: sibling-row agreement is evidence,
# not proof, because the dirty-data majority is sometimes itself the error.

# --- Which declared types actually narrow anything ----------------------------
# A declared type confers authority only if it can reject a value. These spellings cannot:
# every CSV cell is already a string, `read_csv` is called with `dtype=str`, and an
# auto-generated schema emits `str` precisely when it could not determine anything.
#
# Measured consequence of treating `str` as authority, from
# `eval/results/trust_ledger_adversarial.json`: under a tight premise 0 of 14
# constraint-violating attacks were written; under a premise declaring every column `str`,
# **10 of 14** were written, and the gate labelled every write `proven` in both runs. The
# premise's mere presence was doing the work its power was supposed to do.
#
# **Direction of the residual risk, stated plainly.** This is a denylist, and this module's
# contract warns that denylists fail open. Here the enumeration is over types meaning "no
# constraint", so an unrecognised type name confers authority. That is deliberate: the only
# measured harm comes from `str`, and a novel type name is far likelier to be `decimal` or
# `timestamp` -- which genuinely narrow -- than a new synonym for "anything". Silently
# revoking authority from every real schema using an unlisted type would be a regression with
# no evidence behind it. The set is pinned by test rather than left to drift.

# --- Which deterministic repairs may bypass the calibration gate --------------
# A deterministic fix historically auto-applied unconditionally: `partition_auto_apply`
# read `if deterministic or policy.action_for(...)`, so `enabled_classes == []` gave no
# protection at all. That is the hole `decimal_shift` fell through.
#
# Membership here is a claim that the repair is **checkable against a reference** --
# another row sharing a determinant, a declared type, a functional dependency -- rather
# than **inferred from the shape of the column's own distribution**. A distributional
# inference has an error rate, so it must clear a calibrated threshold like any other
# fallible source.
#
# **This is an allowlist, and that is deliberate.** Per this module's contract, a
# denylist of known-bad detectors fails open: any detector nobody thought of would
# bypass calibration by default. A new detector is calibration-bound until it earns
# an entry here with a committed measurement.
#
# `decimal_shift` is excluded by measurement, not by taste: precision 0.0000 on all
# three benchmark datasets and 263,428 false rewrites on a table with no errors in it.
# A schema does not rescue it either -- `113120` satisfies every plausible numeric
# constraint on a price column, so the premise cannot catch this class of wrongness.
#
# `type_mismatch` was REMOVED 2026-08-25, and the reason is the absence of evidence rather
# than evidence of harm. Measured in `docs/trust/bypass-allowlist-evidence.md`: across
# hospital, rayyan and flights -- 4,376 rows and 6,377 real errors -- it flagged 156 cells
# and proposed on **zero** of them. All 156 fail its sentinel test, correctly. So no
# committed measurement of a single real write exists, and the rule two paragraphs up says
# membership requires one.
#
# Zero writes is not a safety result, and `decimal_shift` is why. That rule was
# benchmark-quiet too (39, 92 and 112 flags at precision 0.0000); what removed it was a
# FOURTH dataset, error-free TPC-H. `type_mismatch`'s firing population is a missing
# sentinel in a mostly-numeric column; all three corpora encode missingness as empty
# strings or `x`-substitutions, so that population is absent here while `N/A` in a numeric
# column is among the commonest shapes of real dirty data. These corpora do not measure this
# repairer -- they fail to reach it.
#
# Three further properties, each disqualifying on this module's own terms: its trigger is
# `_is_predominantly_numeric`, a hardcoded 0.65 on the column's own distribution, which the
# paragraph above names as requiring a calibrated threshold; it discards the schema entirely
# (`del schema`), so it has no premise to grade and the discriminating-premise rule cannot
# reach it; and it writes `""`, destroying the value present rather than copying one that
# exists elsewhere in the table.
#
# Removal does NOT disable the repairer. Its fixes now face the calibration threshold like
# every other fallible source, which is the fail-closed direction, and measured cost on all
# three corpora is exactly zero because it wrote nothing there. Pre-registered in
# `eval/preregistration/bypass_allowlist_evidence.md`, whose third outcome branch this is.
#
# `missing_value` and `fd_violation` earned their entries on the same measurement:
# `missing_value` 427 writes / 427 repaired / 0 harmful (precision 1.0000), `fd_violation`
# 0.6602 to 1.0000 with 2037 repaired against 700 harmful.
