          indistinguishable from one matching its row -- verified against DuckDB, which
          returns ``[(0,)]`` -- so the revert silently no-ops and
          ``append_reverted_event`` records it as done.
        * **No post-revert integrity check.** Nothing compared the result against the
          snapshot, which is why ``dataforge revert --json`` reported
          ``restored_source_sha256: null`` beside ``ok: true`` and
          ``audit_verdict: verified`` in ``docs/evidence/dbt_duckdb/commands.log``.

        never read by anything: ``transactions/revert.py`` returns for
        ``source_kind == "table_store"`` eight lines before its only reader. So the
